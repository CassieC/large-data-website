	<h2 class="media-title">Groups of Clouds</h2>
           <p>As established by Howard and his successors, clouds are commonly grouped into physical categories that can be up to five in number: cirriform, cumuliform, cumulonimbiform, stratocumuliform, and stratiform. These designations distinguish a cloud's physical structure and process of formation.</p>
		   </div>
		<div class="span4">
		 <h2 class="media-title">Cirriform</h2>
           <p>Cirriform-category clouds generally have a wispy fibrous appearance and form at high tropospheric altitudes along the very leading edges of a frontal or low-pressure weather disturbance and often along the fringes of its other borders. In general, they are non-convective but occasionally acquire a tufted or turreted appearance caused by small-scale high-altitude convection. These high clouds do not produce precipitation as such[26] but are often accompanied or followed by lower-based clouds that do.</p>
       </div>
        <div class="span4">
          <h2 class="media-title">Cumuliform</h2>
           <p>Cumuliform clouds typically have flat bases and puffy domed tops.[27][28] They are the product of localized but generally free-convective lift and can vary in vertical extent depending on the stability characteristics of the air mass where they are forming. The smallest cumuliform types occur with only minimal instability and can therefore be considered clouds of limited convection. Incoming short-wave radiation generated by the sun is re-emitted as long-wave radiation when it reaches Earth's surface. This process warms the air closest to ground and increases air mass instability by creating a steeper temperature gradient from warm or hot at surface level to cold aloft. Moderate instability allows for the formation of cumuliform clouds of moderate size that can produce light showers if the airmass is sufficiently moist. The more the air is heated from below, the more unstable it tends to become. This may cause large towering cumuliform clouds to form in the lower half of the troposphere with tops growing into the upper levels. These buildups can cause moderate to occasionally heavy showers. They tend to be more concentrated and intense when they are associated with fast-moving unstable cold fronts.</p>
       </div>
	     <div class="span4">
          <h2 class="media-title">Cumulonimbiform</h2>
           <p>The largest free-convective cumuliform clouds often have complex structures that include cirriform tops and multiple accessory clouds and are sometimes classified separately as cumulonimbiform. At maturity, they have very strong updrafts that can penetrate the tropopause. They can produce thunderstorms and a variety of types of lightning including cloud-to-ground that can cause wildfires.[31] Other convective severe weather may or may not be associated with thunderstorms and include heavy rain or snow showers, hail,[32] strong wind shear, downbursts,[33] and tornadoes.[34]</p>
		<h2 class="media-title">Cirrostratus</h2>
		<p>Cirrostratus clouds can appear as a milky sheen in the sky or as a striated sheet. They are sometimes similar to altostratus and are distinguishable from the latter because the sun or moon is always clearly visible through transparent cirrostratus, in contrast to altostratus which tends to be opaque or translucent. Cirrostratus come in two species, fibratus and nebulosus. The ice crystals in these clouds vary depending upon the height in the cloud. Towards the bottom, at temperatures of around −35 °C (−31 °F) to −45 °C (−49 °F), the crystals tend to be long, solid, hexagonal columns. Towards the top of the cloud, at temperatures of around −47 °C (−53 °F) to −52 °C (−62 °F), the predominant crystal types are thick, hexagonal plates and short, solid, hexagonal columns. These clouds commonly produce halos, and sometimes the halo is the only indication that such clouds are present. They are formed by warm, moist air being lifted slowly to a very high altitude. When a warm front approaches, cirrostratus clouds become thicker and descend forming altostratus clouds, and rain usually begins 12 to 24 hours later.</p>
