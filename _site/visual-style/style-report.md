#Style Report

##Style Tile 1

I feel that this style tile has great bold colours that would really attract the user's attention, and the bright colours show the true beauty of clouds. I feel like this look may be too different and bold, it almost gives a 'fiery' look to it, which is not what I really I am looking for. I really like the fonts that were chosen because they are so bold and legible, but I also feel that the type is too chunky for this large data site. Overall, it is bold and the colour scheme is nice, but not quite what I am looking for.

##Style Tile 2

This style tile shows the calm and beauty of the sky. It also has a brighter side to it with the pop of purples. I really enjoy the mix of blues and purples, which are colours we see in the sky. But I feel that it may be too feminine for the male users, and cause them to lose interest because of the colours. The buttons are playful and fun, I really enjoyed this style tile, but I still feel it may be too feminine, I want it to be helpful with the information as well as useful and attractive to all users.

##Style Tile 3

The style tile is probably the best one. It is bright, beautiful and bold, and attractive to any user. The buttons are still playful and the colour scheme really gives the feel of the sky, the clouds and the weather, which are the three main factors that are listed in the site. Overall the type is bold, but not too chunky, the colours are bright and everything seems to work well together. I really feel that this one is the best for my site.
