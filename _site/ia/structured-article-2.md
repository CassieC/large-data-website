Cumulus clouds are a genus-type of low-level cloud that can have noticeable vertical development and clearly defined edges. Cumulo- means "heap" or "pile" in Latin.[1] They are often described as "puffy" or "cotton-like" in appearance, and generally have flat bases. Cumulus clouds, being low-stage clouds, are generally less than 6,500 feet (2,000 m) in altitude unless they are the more vertical cumulus congestus form. Cumulus clouds may appear by themselves, in lines, or in clusters.
