#Scenario 2

##Lola 

**Long Nature Hike**

Lola decided to go on a long nature hike, but the clouds are beginning to darken and are becoming larger and larger. She would like to know when clouds show that there is dangerous weather/lightning storms because it could be dangerous for her to be in the forest and around so many trees while a storm might be forming.
