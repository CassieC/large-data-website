## Observations

- Did the participants have any common comments?
	Both participants didn't seem to have many comments, they were able to figure out most of the cards on their own.
- Did they have questions that stood out?
	Some of the terms were more scientific and they weren't sure what they were, which is when I needed to help them out.
- Did they struggle with certain articles or topics?
	They mostly struggled with the types of clouds, because of the terms used.
- Were some of the groupings completely unexpected?
	Not really.
- Were the results similar to your expectations?
	Yes, most of it was straight forward.
- How did you feel while watching them perform the task?
	Good, they performed the card sorting a lot better than I thought they would.
