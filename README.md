# Clouds

I chose this topic because I've always loved the sky. I think the clouds and the weather are very interesting. 

I knew that there was a large amount of information about the subject and it would be fun to learn more about them; especially since I haven't really studied the sky and the clouds since elementary school.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to design a large scale website.
